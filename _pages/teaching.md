Over the past years I have tought several courses including “Data Science and Machine Learning” (Bachelor), “Analytics and Applications” (Master),
“Advanced Analytics and Applications” (Master). Curently I am only teaching the master course named “Analytics and Applications”. This course aims to provide students with knowledge and skills required for data analytics using information systems that drive business success. 

Business analytics is the use of data-driven decision making. Companies, governments, and other organizations now collect and have access to large amounts of data about suppliers, clients, employees, citizens, transactions, etc. Data Mining and predictive analytics provide a powerful toolkit for detecting actionable patterns in data and generating predictions. These methods are used in many industries: Mobile companies use their customer database to predict customer churn or to personalize SMS messages for improving customer service; Financial institutions use past loan data to predict defaulting chance for
loan applicants; Charities use data from a campaign in one location to target the right people in another location; Politicians use databases of supporters to segment and best target each audience; Movie rental and e-Commerce websites provide recommendations based on users' online behavior; Renewable energy
providers use weather forecasts to predict their electricity generation to better trade in different types of
markets.

Most business analytics applications are geared towards benefiting the company, often at the expense of the individual, community, and society. The focus of this course is on human and socially-responsible business analytics, especially with the focus on sustainability.
In this course we will work with real business problems and real data. We will examine types of questions that data mining can answer and will develop a variety of data-driven tools to answer these questions. The emphasis is on understanding the concepts and logic behind a wide set of data mining techniques and their relation to specific business analytics situations. The gained knowledge will be applied on a business analytics team project that encapsulates the learnings, while is not expected to master the theoretical underpinnings of the techniques.

On the link below you can find notebooks of the course, including a summary of the lecture as well as the python implementation.
